#HARD MODE FOR NOOBS

Noob = Me

After the first slicing project, I felt like I understood CSS layout concepts, but this project proved that there were still things I didn't fully grasp.

Those things:
..* How to properly center div elements
..*...wait, what is a div element exactly?  Block elements?  Oh.

From here on, I need to focus on writing my CSS more efficiently.  This will help out with my confusing concepts and doubting myself, only to find that I've written something wrong or confused an element with something else.

The CSS Layout tutorial included in previous notes helped out a lot.  I will definitely be coming back to that in the coming weeks.
